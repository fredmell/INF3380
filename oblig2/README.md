# Oblig 2 INF3380 (Mandatory assignment 2) - Parallel programming

This project is an implementation of Cannon's algorithm for multiplying
two matrices. The C implementation uses MPI and OpenMP and is found in the
*src* directory. Example input, output and solution matrices are found in *data*,
and a python script which compares matrices is found under *analysis*.
